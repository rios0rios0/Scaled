description: "Review pull requests and diffs in scaled — the TypeScript oclif CLI that orchestrates Docker services and security tooling — against the rios0rios0/guide standards: the DDD domain/infrastructure split, the resolver strategy pattern, no `any`, and command-injection safety. Use when reviewing a PR, a branch, or staged changes here."

# Code review — `scaled`

`scaled` starts, scales, and reports on Dockerised services from a single `scaled start` command, with pluggable resolver strategies and an Nmap reporting pipeline. It builds and runs containers and shells out to security tools, so input handling around those calls is the highest-risk area.

## When to use this skill

Use it whenever you are asked to review a pull request, a diff, a branch, or staged changes
in this repository — and before opening a pull request of your own, as a self-check. It is a
**review** skill: it produces findings, not commits.

## Source of truth

The canonical engineering standards live in the
**[rios0rios0/guide wiki](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki)**. This file is a
repo-tailored index into that guide plus the rules that only apply here. Precedence, highest
first:

1. This repository's `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` —
   they describe *this* codebase and its load-bearing invariants.
2. The **rios0rios0/guide** wiki — the shared standard.
3. General language idiom.

When the guide and a general convention disagree, the guide wins. When this file and the
guide disagree, the guide wins and this file should be corrected in the same pull request.

## How to run the review

1. **Establish the range.** Resolve the default branch with
   `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` (strip `refs/remotes/origin/`; fall back to `main`),
   then read the diff with `git diff <default>...HEAD` and the file list with
   `git diff <default>...HEAD --name-only`.
2. **Read whole files, not just hunks.** A hunk cannot show a layering violation, a missing
   test, or a duplicated helper. Open every changed file in full, plus the files it imports
   from the layer below.
3. **Check the change set as a unit** — not only the code. A change that alters behaviour,
   configuration, or architecture is incomplete without its changelog entry and its
   documentation update, and that omission is a finding in its own right.
4. **Map every finding to a rule.** Each finding must name the rule it breaks and link the
   guide page (or the repository file) that states it. A comment that cannot be traced to a
   rule is a suggestion, not a defect — label it as such.
5. **Report, do not rewrite.** Produce the review in the output format below. Only edit files
   when the request explicitly asks for fixes.

## What matters most in `scaled`

These are the checks that catch real defects in this repository. Work through
them before the generic ones.

```
src/commands/start.ts        the only CLI command
src/domain/entities|repositories|services/    contracts (NmapReadableReport, ReportService)
src/infrastructure/repositories|services/     implementations (NmapReportService)
src/resolver/strategy/       pluggable execution strategies behind ResolverInterface
src/manager/                 ServiceManager: start / stop / report lifecycle
src/helpers/                 display.ts, sqs.ts
tools/nmap|nikto|sqlmap/     dockerised tool definitions
```

- **A new execution target is a new strategy under `src/resolver/strategy/`** implementing `ResolverInterface` — only `LocalResolver` exists so far. Adding a branch to the resolver instead of a strategy is a finding.
- **`--set-env KEY=VALUE`, service names, and container counts are user input that reaches a shell.** Concatenating any of them into a command string is a **Critical** command-injection finding; pass arguments as an array and validate the shape first.
- **`yarn prepack` must run before `./bin/run`** because the compiled output lives in `lib/`. A change to the build output path or the oclif manifest generation breaks the CLI without breaking the tests.
- **Domain contracts stay free of oclif, AWS, and Docker.** `src/domain/` defines interfaces; `src/infrastructure/` implements them. An AWS SDK import in the domain layer is a Critical finding.
- **`helpers/sqs.ts` handles AWS credentials** — they come from the environment or the instance role, never from a flag default or a committed literal, and must not be logged.
- **The container lifecycle must be leak-free.** `ServiceManager.start`/`stop` should leave nothing running when a command fails halfway; check the error paths, not just the happy path.
- **`tools/nikto/` and `tools/sqlmap/` are placeholders** (`.gitkeep` only). Do not report them as broken; do reject code that assumes they are implemented.
- ESLint runs with `airbnb-typescript` rules — a new disable comment needs a reason.

### Commands a reviewer should be able to quote

```bash
yarn install
yarn prepack           # tsc → lib/, oclif manifest, README update (~10-20 s)
yarn lint              # ESLint, airbnb-typescript
yarn test              # mocha + nyc
./bin/run start <service> [--build] [--containers <n>] [--set-env KEY=VALUE]
```

## Architecture and layering

See [Architecture](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/Architecture) and [Backend Design](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/Backend-Design).

Dependencies point **inward**, always. Infrastructure depends on the domain; the domain
never imports infrastructure, a framework, a driver, or an SDK. The layer boundary is the
first thing to check on any new file:

- An import of a concrete client, ORM, HTTP library, or cloud SDK from inside the domain
  layer is a **Critical** finding, no matter how convenient.
- Entities hold business rules and stay framework-agnostic — no serialisation tags, no ORM
  annotations, no transport concerns. Tags belong on DTOs in the infrastructure layer.
- New external dependencies enter through a port (an interface owned by the consumer) and an
  adapter that implements it. Code that reaches past the port to the concrete type breaks
  the pattern even when it compiles.
- Mappers isolate the layers: a repository mapper converts between models and entities, a
  controller mapper between requests/responses and entities. Leaking a transport DTO into
  the domain is a finding.
- Operation names come from the standard vocabulary: `List`, `Get`, `Insert`, `Update`,
  `Delete`, `BatchInsert`, `BatchUpdate`, `BatchDelete`, `DeleteAll`.

## JavaScript / TypeScript conventions

See [JavaScript & TypeScript Conventions](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/JavaScript) and
[Testing](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/JavaScript-Testing).

- File names are `snake_case`; `id` and `data-test-subj` attribute values are `camelCase`.
- **Never `any`** — use `unknown` and narrow. An `any` added to silence the compiler is a
  finding, and so is a blanket `@ts-ignore` without a justification comment.
- Favour immutability (`const`, spread, `map`/`filter`/`reduce`) over in-place mutation, and
  use object and array destructuring rather than repeated member access.
- Prefer modern syntax: arrow functions, template strings, optional chaining, nullish
  coalescing.
- Tests are BDD-structured with `// given` / `// when` / `// then`, and they exercise
  business rules and user flows rather than framework internals.

### Dispatch tables over `switch`

See [Mapper Design Pattern](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/Mapper-Design-Pattern). Two or three stable cases may stay a
`switch`. Four or more, or a set that grows with features, becomes a map from key to handler
so that adding a case is a new entry rather than an edit to the dispatcher. Flag new
`switch`/`if-else` chains that dispatch on a string or enum key.

### YAML

See [YAML Conventions](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/YAML). The extension is `.yaml`, never `.yml`. String values are
single-quoted; double quotes appear only where interpolation or an escape needs them;
booleans and numbers are never quoted. This applies to workflows, compose files, manifests,
and YAML blocks inside Markdown.

## Tests

See [Tests](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/Tests).

- `test/` is thin today — a behavioural change should bring a test with it, using the BDD blocks below.
- Report parsing (`NmapReportService`) is the easiest thing to test well: feed a recorded Nmap output fixture and assert the parsed entity.

### Rules that hold for every test in this repository

- **BDD blocks are mandatory.** Every test body carries `// given` / `// when` / `// then`
  (`# given` / `# when` / `# then` in Python) delimiting preconditions, the action, and the
  assertions. A test without them is a finding.
- **Descriptions follow the layer.** Commands: `"should call <listener> when …"`.
  Controllers: `"should respond <HTTP_STATUS> when …"`. Services and repositories:
  `"should … when …"`, with at least one success and one failure case per public method.
- **Mock libraries are banned** — the category, not just the names: `testify/mock`,
  `golang/mock`, `mockery`, `go-sqlmock`, `httpmock`, `gock`, Mockito, EasyMock, PowerMock,
  `unittest.mock`, `pytest-mock`, `responses`, `requests-mock`, `jest.mock()` module mocking,
  `sinon`, `nock`, `testdouble`. Doubles are hand-rolled: stubs return canned answers,
  in-memory implementations hold state, and a spy that records calls is used only when
  nothing observable exists. Reaching for a mock library almost always means a port is
  missing — extract the interface the consumer needs instead.
- **Driver-level and transport-level mocks are the worst case.** SQL and HTTP behaviour is
  proven against the real thing: a real database with the real migrations for stores, a real
  local test server for outbound clients. Those are not mocks; they are real implementations
  under test control.
- **Builders construct test data.** Complex entities and DTOs come from builders, not from
  long literal structs repeated across files.
- A test deleted, skipped, or weakened to make a change pass is a Critical finding.

## Documentation and change control

See [Documentation & Change Control](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/Documentation-&-Change-Control) and
[CHANGELOG Formatting](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/CHANGELOG-Formatting).

This repository uses **chlog fragments**. `CHANGELOG.md` is generated and is never edited by
hand.

- Every change ships a fragment created with `chlog new --kind <Kind> --body '…'`, staged in
  the **same commit** as the code. Kinds: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`,
  `Fixed`, `Security`.
- A backward-incompatible change to the public interface additionally carries `--breaking`.
  The kind alone never triggers a major bump.
- A hand-edited `CHANGELOG.md`, or a code change with no fragment under
  `.changes/unreleased/`, is a **Critical** finding — `chlog check` fails the build for it.
- Fragment bodies start with a lowercase verb in simple past tense, capitalise proper nouns
  (GitHub, Go, Docker), and wrap code identifiers and versions in backticks.
- `README.md` is updated whenever usage, setup, configuration, or architecture changes;
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `CLAUDE.md` whenever the workflow, commands, or
  structure changes. Documentation and code ship in one commit.

## Git Flow and pull-request hygiene

See [Git Flow](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/Git-Flow) and [Merge Guide](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/Merge-Guide).

- Branch names are `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `chore/`, `test/`, or `docs/` followed by a
  ticket ID or a short slug — `feat/TICKET-000`, `fix/input-mask`.
- Commit subjects are `type(SCOPE): message`: simple past tense (`added`, `fixed`, `changed`,
  `removed`), lowercase first word, no trailing period, code identifiers in backticks.
- Branches are synchronised with `git rebase`, never `git merge`. A merge commit from the
  default branch inside a feature branch is a finding.
- Breaking changes are flagged in **three** places: the commit footer
  (`**BREAKING CHANGE:** …`), the changelog, and the pull-request description. One or two of
  the three is not enough.
- Versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/): MAJOR for incompatible changes, MINOR for
  features, PATCH for fixes.

## Security

See [Security](https://github.com/rios0rios0/guide/wiki/Security).

- **No hard-coded secrets.** API keys, tokens, passwords, and private keys belong in
  environment variables or a secret manager — never in source, tests, fixtures, or the
  changelog. A secret that reaches a commit must be rotated, not merely deleted.
- **Never write a PEM header sentinel or a realistic key shape into a fixture** (GitHub,
  OpenAI, AWS, or Slack token prefixes, JWT-shaped strings, or the dashed `BEGIN …` banners).
  Gitleaks matches the shape, not the value, so a placeholder that merely *looks* like a
  credential fails the pipeline — spelling those prefixes out here would trip it too. Use
  inert placeholders such as `fixture-token-placeholder`.
- **Suppressions must be justified.** Entries in `.gitleaksignore`, `.trivyignore`,
  `.semgrepignore`, or `.codeql-false-positives` need a fingerprint, a dated comment, and a
  reason. A suppression added to silence a real finding is a Critical.
- Validate and sanitise every external input; use parameterised queries; apply least
  privilege; keep secrets out of logs.
- Dependency manifest changes are reviewed for new transitive vulnerabilities. When a fix
  exists, bump the version rather than suppressing the finding.

## What not to flag

A review that raises noise gets ignored. Do not report these:

- `node_modules/` and `lib/` in the tree — build output, not source.
- The empty `nikto`/`sqlmap` tool directories.
- Anything the guide does not require and this file does not list, unless it is a genuine correctness or security defect — say so plainly and label it a Suggestion.

## Review output format

```
## Code review: <branch or PR>

### Critical (must fix before merge)
- `path/to/file.ext:LINE` — <what is wrong> — violates <rule> (<guide page or repo file>)

### Warning (should fix)
- `path/to/file.ext:LINE` — <what is wrong> — violates <rule>

### Suggestion (optional)
- `path/to/file.ext:LINE` — <improvement>

### Change-control checklist
- [ ] Changelog entry present for every behavioural change
- [ ] `README.md` updated if usage, setup, or architecture changed
- [ ] `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `CLAUDE.md` updated if the workflow, commands, or structure changed
- [ ] Commit messages follow `type(SCOPE): message` in simple past tense
- [ ] Breaking changes flagged in the commit footer, the changelog, and the PR description

### Verdict: APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES

## Severity

| Severity       | Use for                                                                                                                            |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Critical**   | Broken dependency direction, a leaked secret, an injection or authentication flaw, a missing changelog entry, a banned mock library, a load-bearing invariant broken, a test deleted rather than fixed. |
| **Warning**    | Naming that departs from the guide, a missing test for a new branch of logic, an unexplained magic value, a stale README or instructions file, a `switch` that should be a map. |
| **Suggestion** | Readability, consistency with neighbouring modules, and performance ideas that no rule mandates.                                     |

Rank findings most severe first, and state plainly when nothing blocks the merge — an empty
Critical section is a valid, useful review.
